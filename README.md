# Multiple-Barcode-Detection

In this Project, the method will recognize the barcodes using image processing. Images will be taken using mobile camera sensor. It will detect 1D barcodes such as EAN-13
barcodes, Code-128 barcodes, 2D barcodes such as QR codes. Moreover it will be angle invariant, requires no user interaction and can be executed on available computers. This model helps consumers to minimize
the time for the billing system in shopping. We have implemented this in Python IDE using OpenCV library.
